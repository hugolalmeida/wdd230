The Fresh page contains a form that allows the user to build a specialty drink.
The form requires the following items: 
first name,
email,
phone, 
three (3) select inputs that are populated with the available fruit to put into a drink. Available fruit options must only come from this JSON data source: FRUIT Links to an external site. for full credit consideration.
and, include an area that allows them to add special instructions if needed.
Do NOT send the form to a new page upon form submission.  Instead, use a JavaScript event handler to produce a formatted output area on this same page showing:
the input values of the order (7 inputs = first name, email, phone, three selected fruits, and special instructions),
the order date, and 
the total amount of carbohydrates, protein, fat, sugar, and calories based upon the three fruit choices selected on the form. Again, use the JSON fruit data to extract and sum up that information.
